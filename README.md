# TickTick MCP v2

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for TickTick that enables interacting with your TickTick task management system directly through Claude and other MCP clients using v2 interfaces.

## Project Purpose

This project addresses two key challenges in the current TickTick MCP landscape:

1. **Complex Authentication**: The v1 interface requires overly complex authentication methods, which are not as straightforward as direct username/password authentication.

2. **Limited API Functionality**: The official v1 API interfaces provide limited functionality and make it cumbersome to implement more complex features. For example, other TickTick MCP implementations cannot even retrieve tasks from the Inbox.

## Features

- üìã View all your TickTick projects and tasks
- ‚úèÔ∏è Create new projects and tasks through natural language
- üîÑ Update existing task details (title, content, dates, priority)
- ‚úÖ Mark tasks as complete
- üóëÔ∏è Delete tasks and projects
- üîê Username/password authentication with local credential storage

## Quick Start

Create a `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ticktick-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "ticktick-mcp-v2", "ticktick-mcp", "run"],
      "env": {
        "TICKTICK_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "TICKTICK_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Start Using

You can now interact with your TickTick tasks directly! Try asking:
- "Show me all my TickTick projects"
- "Create a task called 'Finish documentation' with high priority"
- "What tasks do I have due today?"

## Development Setup

1. **Install and authenticate:**
   ```bash
   uvx --from ticktick-mcp-v2 ticktick-mcp auth
   ```

2. **Test the connection:**
   ```bash
   uvx --from ticktick-mcp-v2 ticktick-mcp test
   ```

3. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   uvx --from ticktick-mcp-v2 ticktick-mcp run
   ```
